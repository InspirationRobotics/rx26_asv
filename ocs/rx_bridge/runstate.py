"""runstate — the run's state machine, and nothing else.

No MQTT, no protobuf, no I/O: the handbook's start-of-run sequence is a set of
rules about ordering, and rules you can exercise on a laptop are rules you can
trust at the dock. bridge.py owns the sockets; this file owns what is allowed.

THE SEQUENCE (handbook 3.4), which is the reason this file exists:

    subscribe -> receive RxCourse -> publish RunDeclaration
              -> publish heartbeats -> receive RunStart matching declaration_seq

Note where heartbeats begin: AFTER the declaration and BEFORE RunStart, not
after the run starts. A bridge that waits for RunStart before reporting will sit
silent through the exact window RoboCommand is watching to confirm the team is
alive. So DECLARED permits reports; everything earlier does not.

THE RECONNECT RULE. On a dropped connection we return to whatever state we were
in, and we DO NOT re-declare. Re-declaring mints a new RxRequest.seq, and
RoboCommand's RunStart carries the declaration_seq it intends to answer -- so a
reflexive re-declare on reconnect orphans the RunStart we are waiting for and
the run never starts. Restoring subscriptions is bridge.py's job; remembering
that we were already declared is this file's.
