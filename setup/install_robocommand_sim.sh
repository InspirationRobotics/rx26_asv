# setup/install_robocommand_sim.sh — the SIMULATED RoboNation server
#
# Builds the third machine in the Gate G3 bench: a Linux box that pretends to
# be RoboCommand. It holds 192.168.65.2, serves DHCP on one ethernet interface,
# and runs RoboNation's own docker stub. Nothing else.
#
# It reproduces what the competition hands you: an RJ-45 cable and a DHCP lease
# on the course subnet. That matters more than it sounds. The handbook forbids
# a static address on the OCS's RoboCommand-facing interface, so "we always ran
# it static on the bench" is how you discover at Alpha that something hardcodes
# an IP.
#
#   sim box  192.168.65.2  ── straight ethernet ──  OCS  ── wifi ──  team router
#   (this script)                                                    192.168.8.0/24
#
# THE SIM BOX MUST NOT BE ON THE TEAM NETWORK AT THE SAME TIME. Two interfaces
# plus the ip_forward=1 that Docker sets for you is a router, and a router
# between the course subnet and the team subnet is precisely the topology the
# handbook prohibits -- the boat would reach RoboCommand through this machine.
# Pull the images while you have internet, then take the wifi down. --check
# tests for it.
#
# Usage:
#   bash setup/install_robocommand_sim.sh --list             # candidate interfaces
#   bash setup/install_robocommand_sim.sh --iface enp3s0     # build it
#   bash setup/install_robocommand_sim.sh --iface enp3s0 --check   # verify only
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run; it only writes what is missing or wrong.

Done. Next:

  1. Take this machine OFF the team network / wifi. It must reach nothing but
     the OCS. Then:
         bash setup/install_robocommand_sim.sh --iface $iface --check

  2. Start the stub:
         cd $REPO_DIR/RobotX_2026 && docker compose up --build
     Confirm 1883 is NOT bound to 127.0.0.1 -- a broker on loopback is
     invisible from the OCS:
         ss -lnt | grep 1883

  3. Cable this box to the OCS. On the OCS, confirm it leased an address in
     ${SUBNET}.0/24 -- leased, not static. Then in ocs/bridge.toml:
         [robocommand]
         host = "$SELF"

  4. From the JETSON:  ping $SELF   ->  this MUST fail.
     If it succeeds you are non-compliant. See docs/G3_robocommand_bench.md B4.
